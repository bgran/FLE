Fle3 for Debian
---------------

Fle3 is installed in /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products/FLE.
Zope must be restarted before new products can be used. If
you didn't let Debian restart Zope automatically, you'll
need to do that (zopectl restart) yourself. Then you just
access the management interface and add a new FLE environment.
